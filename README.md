<h3>Problem I was facing?</h3>
I often read various blog and articles regarding Digital Marketing, Data Science, Web Development. To read these blogs I have to go through various website. So being lazy I didn't want to go through every website in order to read blog.

<h3>How did I solve it!</h3>
In order to read blog in one place, firstly I listed website which I visit to read blog and article. Then I scraped these website using BeautifulSoup and to show scraped data created website using Python Flask.
